For this lab you will load a new dataset and a subset of that dataset. The data to be used is available in Canvas and has been downloaded from the SCB website (www.scb.se). The full dataset includes mean income by region, age and year while the provided subset contains the average income by age from 20 to 50 years only.
The objective of this lab is to conduct regression analysis. The focus will be on performing multiple linear regressions using the same dataset to assess their effectiveness in various segments. Additionally, you will explore alternative regression techniques to address the dataset, followed by a reflective analysis of these options.
