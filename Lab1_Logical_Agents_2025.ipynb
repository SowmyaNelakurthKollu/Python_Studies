        "In this lab you will implement propositional logic which will be the foundation of our AI agent.\n",
        "Initially it might seem strange to implement propositional logic, since python already has it implemented in the simple ```not```, ```and```, ```or```, and ```==``` operators (implication can be derived from these as well).\n",
        "While its true that any propositional logic statement can be evaluated using Python, these statements cannot be stored in their unevaluated form (which is desirable to form a Knowledge Base- KB).\n",
        "Additionally, we cannot create variables without assigning them value in standard Python, but when we later want to iterate over all possible models the variables will need to take on many possible values.\n",
        "\n",
        "So we will need to implement our own version of propositional logic in Python.\n",
        "For variables we will use strings to represent them and later we can use dictionaries to represent models and then look up the value of each variable in that model.\n",
        "For True and False we will simply use the existing ```True``` and ```False``` values in Python.\n",
        "For all the operators we will implement classes that contain the logic sentences they operate on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Task 1:\n",
        " Given  a skeleton for the \"and\" operator, you need to expand it to each of the other operators.\n",

        "### Querying for possible models from a Knowledge Base\n",
        "\n",
        "Task 7: Now we are ready to create a knowledge base.\n",
        "Making a knowledge base is not that difficult, it's simply a collection of logical sentences that are known (or presumed) to be true in a given environment.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create this collection we will use the Python ```set``` data structure.\n",
        "The reason is that sets can only contain one of each element so we don't risk adding the same sentence multiple times.\n",
        "Sets can be created by listing  a number of elements in curly brackets (```{}```), and elements can be added and removed with the ```.add()``` and ```.remove()``` functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The more difficult part is then creating a function for querying the knowledge base for whether a new sentence is true or not.\n",
        "One simple way to do this query is to test every possible model (every possible combination of truth values for the variables).\n",
        "For each model we figure out whether the query sentence is True or False, we then also check that all sentences in the knowledge base are True for that model.\n",
        "Since we \"know\" that each sentence in the knowledge base should be true, any model that doesn't align with this can be discarded as an \"invalid\" model of our environment.\n",
        "For all \"valid\" models we then return whether that model is True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course many environments have a huge amount of variables which would then require us to check a huge number of models.\n",
        "If we have $n$ variables in the environment we would need to check each sentence $n^2$ times.\n",
        "However,  not every variable is necessarily relevant for our query sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using our knowledge of the environment we might be able to deduce the minimum number of variables that are relevant for our query and only test all combinations of them.\n",
        "This is why we implemented the concept of unknown (```None```) values earlier.\n",
        "Due to this we also consider a model \"valid\" if sentence is the knowledge base evaluate as unknown.\n",
        "This comes with a risk of course, if we mistakenly exclude a relevant variable in our query a model that should be \"invalid\" might be considered \"valid\" since a False evaluation might now be unknown.\n",
        "Additionally, we need to return all \"valid\" models that are unknown.\n",
        "\n",
        "We can then use this query function to figure things about the environment.\n",
        "If a query sentence only gives \"valid\" models in which it is True, then we know the sentence is True in the environment.\n",
        "Conversely, if all returned models are False, the sentence is False in the environment.\n",
        "If it returns some True models and some False models we know that, given what we know of the environment we cannot yet tell whether the sentence is True or not (in some advanced scenarios we might be able to use the number of True/False models to estimate the likelihood of the query being True/False in the actual environment).\n",
        "If some of the returned models are unknown models, we know that there are relevant variables that were not considered in the query.\n",
        "This likely means we have an error in the code that determines which variables should be relevant for a query.\n",
        "Note that many variables that are not in the query sentence could still be relevant.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, if the function returns no valid models at all, this means that there are contradictions in the knowledge base and something has gone wrong in its construction.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below you will find the skeleton of the query function for you to complete."
